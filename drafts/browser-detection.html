</p>

<p>
	Despite all of this information, browser detection can be seen in most of the popular 
	JavaScript libraries including Prototype,
	YUI, Dojo, jQuery, and is present in applications such as the newly refactored GMail:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
	For a better Gmail experience, use a fully supported browser.   
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Browser detection is bad for many reasons:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Browsers change. </li>
	<li>The User Agent string does not represent the browser reliably. </li>
	<li>Even if it did, the browser doesn't represent feature support (See #1). </li>
</ol>

<p>
Browser detection is unrelated to the problem it is trying
to solve.
</p>

<p>
Browser detection makes code hard to maintain. It accomplishes this by 
requiring that the next version of [insert_browser_name] will also have to be tested 
and special-cased in the code.
</p>

<h3>Alternative: Feature Detection</h3>
<p>
For example, does the browser support <code>opacity</code>? This can easily be determined:
</p>

<pre>
if("opacity"in el.style) { }
</pre>

<p>
Support of <code>opacity</code> has nothing to do with whether that
browser actually is an IE version, nor is the reverse true: IE does not imply 
support (or lack of support) for <code>opacity</code>.
</p>

<p>
Detection for feature support does not suffer from maintenance 
problems when Internet Explorer decides to support <code>opacity</code>. <a href="/web/20071127073401/http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/using-capability-detection/">Capability detection</a> takes feature detection one step further.
</p>


<p>
Once the code has been properly designed and tested, it should not be a problem to maintain.
</p>

<p>
I have learned this the hard way and have tried to remove browser detection from 
my drag code, though evidence of my mistake is still present. I had to refactor my drag code in specific cases where it checked for browsers identifying with an Opera User Agent string (removed checks to <code>ua.opera</code>). My code still contains one conditional branch that needs to be refactored, As is, the script works in all of the modern browsers (this is subject to change).
</p>

<p>
With browser detection, the <a href="/web/20071127073401/http://books.google.com/books?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=internal+quality+beck&source=web&ots=GI592TgTag&sig=NwxZNg0dSzxPkgZpn5GYtTcIe54"
>internal quality</a> of the code suffers, even if the code works. This is because it introduces a dynamic aspect that must be maintained as the browsers change. <a href="/web/20071127073401/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ImplementationDoesTooMatter">Implementation Matters</a>.
</p>

<h3>ToBoolean</h3>

<p>
Be careful when testing for values of properties. Some values may evaluate to 
false in a boolean context.
</p>

<pre>
<strong>// Error-prone, scrollTop may be 0, which would evaluate to false</strong>
if (document.body.scrollTop) {
    // statements that work with scrollTop property
}
</pre>

<h3>The new GMail</h3>
<p>New code should definitely not rely on browser detection</p>
<p>
GMail, which was recently redesigned, still uses browser detection and also punishes users with the performance hit of a misused HTTP redirect (HTTP/1.x 302 Moved Temporarily), or, if GMail finds your browser's User Agent header unsuitable, it <em>two</em> HTTP redirects. 
</p>

<p>
In fact, when developing for mobile phones, I have found 
Chris Penderick's 
<a href="/web/20071127073401/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59">UserAgent switcher</a>, 
indespensible. Unfortunately, this confuses GMail, messing up the 
rendering and even encoding of messages.
</p>

<p>
GMail seems to be predominantly developed with a windows-centric mentality. 
This is evidenced by the lack of support for Command + S to save in 
Mac, and the Safari and Opera bugs witnessed in earlier versions of GMail.
</p>

<p>
Both GMail and Yahoo Mail could use feature detection to load additional, specific script resources (after page load, to decrease page layout time). 
</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>
GMail deserves proper recognition for providing a clear example of why browser detection is a bad practice.
</p>

<h3>Contrasting Example</h3>
<p>
For proof that an effective Ajax application can be developed <em>without</em> browser detection, have a look at <a 
href="/web/20071127073401/http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Browser Detection is mostly a bad idea. 
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'm looking for a decent mail application that runs in the browser. Both Yahoo mail 
and GMail fall short of my expectations.
